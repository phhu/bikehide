# bikehide

A [Freitag](https://www.freitag.ch) bag for your bike? A [Bikehanger](https://cyclehoop.com/product-category/bikehangars/) without the hanger?

A bikehide is weatherproof bicycle cover made from recycled truck tarpaulin that mounts on a fence outside your home, and flips open in seconds.

No faff, no planning permission, no wet bum.
