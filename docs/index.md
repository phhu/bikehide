# BIKEHIDE

A [Freitag](https://www.freitag.ch) bag for your bike? A [Bikehanger](https://cyclehoop.com/product-category/bikehangars/) without the hanger? Or just a [bicycle cover](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=bicycle+cover) that doesn't become a soggy windbeaten faff once you take it off on a winter's morning?

A BIKEHIDE is recycled truck tarpaulin bicycle cover that mounts on a fence and stays there while you go riding. It makes getting on your bike quicker and drier.

No faff, no planning permission, no wet bum.
